          <h2>Westlands Nairobi</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>Westlands</b> is located approximately 3.2 kilometers by road, northwest of the Nairobi central business district of Nairobi. The geographical coordinates of the neighborhood are: 01°16'01.0"S, 36°48'42.0"E (Latitude: -1.266944; Longitude:36.811667) <b>Westlands</b> is traditionally Nairobi’s social and entertainment Centre for expatriates and wealthy Kenyans, a lively cluster of shops, restaurants, bars and nightclubs 3 km to the northwest of the central business district. One of the city’s largest modern shopping plazas, the four-storey Sarit Centre, is here, competing with two smaller centres nearby. There are dozens of restaurants, three late-night western-style bars, two nightclubs and a casino. Westlands is a favorite with Nairobi’s large Indian/Asian community. The residential roads ringing the busy hub are popular with Kenyans and expatriates, young singles who live in 1980s/1990s apartment blocks, as well as families in older houses, all attracted by the choice of facilities. The quieter, smarter streets spread into Spring Valley to the north, where the apartment blocks give way to bungalows and large, detached houses. Some streets here are gated, with security staff screening visitors. The <b>Westlands</b> and <b>Parklands</b> districts make for an ideal compromise. The endlessly informative and must-see Nairobi National Museum is close to the Westlands, and you can buy great books and crafts at the museum shop even if you don’t enter the exhibition area, though we earnestly recommend you do. The <b>Westlands</b> has a large number of bars and restaurants. The area is generally busy enough that it is safe enough to walk around with peace of mind. Head to Electric Avenue to go barhopping of check out J’s Fresh Bar and Kitchen – a favorite with the locals that has live music every Thursday night. Local breweries are on the rise in Kenya just as they seem to be elsewhere, so for fans of beer and those wanting to see how the Kenyans do it, Nairobi offers quite a lot of options, especially in this area. Have a pint of the local standard brew – Tusker. The Sankara hotel rooftop bar offers a stunning view of the famous, heart-wrenchingly gorgeous African sunset. The Westlands, due to its large Indian community, also offers quite a large variety of desi restaurants: from Punjabi through Gujarati to South Indian cuisine, you can find all of it here and get some much-needed fiber in your diet. One place that Indians in Nairobi swear by is Open House, thanks in no small part to its authentic desserts. For shopping, head over to Parklands and check out the Made in Kenya store on Parklands Rd. to get some superb quality local fashion. These districts have a few casinos since gambling is not only legal but a favorite pastime with the residents in Nairobi. Go and try your luck before you head back home to one of these places:

          <h2>Nairobi City </h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>Nairobi</b> has become synonym with safaris and wild animals because of its close proximity to some of the biggest nature parks in East Africa. But Kenya’s capital is also a metropolitan, busy city with plenty of things to do, places to discover, and attractions worth a visit. The city has become a great culinary destination as well, with markets and restaurants ready to keep you busy (and very well-fed) before you head off into the wilderness. The heart of cosmopolitan Nairobi, the Central Business District (CBD) is filled with all manner of things to see and do, day or night. The plus in staying in the <b>Nairobi</b> is, of course, the action and vibrancy, but the glaringly obvious minus is the feeling of being locked in a concrete jungle when you could be out with nature. The hustle and bustle may be exciting and distracting, but you are advised to be on your guard here as petty crime is rampant. If you’ve got nowhere to be and no plans to occupy you, the <b>Nairobi</b> is the best area for meandering around. We must warn you however not to talk on the phone while crossing the road, as this is strictly verboten. The downtown area has some of the best bars and <b>restaurants in Nairobi</b>. Try Nyama Choma, which is Swahili for barbecue. You will find all of the classic meats, as well as farm-raised ostrich and crocodile. Nairobi City Market is the best place in town shopping. Another must-see is the Nairobi Maasai Market, located between the CBD and the Westlands. Haggling is a hot-button issue here: it is encouraged, and one could even say required, but too much of it can quickly turn insulting. The Maasai take pride in their craft and don’t want to give it to you at any cost. Be reasonable but respectful. Head up to the Kenyatta Convention Center helipad for the best and vastest views of the city. Have a cocktail at Lord Delamere Terrace & Bar, est. 1904, and think about the fact that a little over four miles away there are lions, giraffes, elephants, and rhinos roaming around. The perhaps most important thing to keep in mind when visiting Nairobi is not to let worry cloud your fun. The Kenyan capital is an endlessly entertaining and welcoming place to find yourself any time. The contrast Nairobi offers in the wild and untouched landscape spreading eternally from it, interrupted in its arid, flat way only by the skyscrapers and noise of a metropolis, is something you won’t soon forget.
